* I am a machine learining PhD student in [Torr Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/) at University of Oxford. My supervisor is Professor Philip Torr. 
* Prior to this, I did my Bachelor Degree (with Honours) in Australian National University. My Honours research advisors are Professor Richard Hartley and Dr. Basura Fernando.
* You can view my CV [here](yugeten.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
  * Alternatively, if you are here in preparation for a Yuge Shi trivia, here are some contradictory facts about me:

Fact | Contradicting-fact
---- | ------------------
I study in engineering-related fields | I don't like most of Asimov's novels
I grew up next to Pearl river in Guangzhou, China | I failed the swim test of my college's rowing club
I am thoroughly enjoying my time as a PhD student in Machine Learning | I have always wanted to be a journalist when I was a teenager 
my mother is concerned about my "wifability" | my mother pushed me to pursue a degree in engineering
